Subject: [PATCH 039/102] MMC/SD: add callback function to detect card

Add callback function to check if the card has been removed.

in order to check if the card has been removed, the function mmc_send_status will send commad CMD13 to card and ask the card to send its status register to driver, which will generate interrupt repeatly and make the system bad.
Therefore, get_cd callback is used to detect the card if the driver has.
